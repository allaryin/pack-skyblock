Welcome to The Best of Both Skyblocks 2, a pack made by Haydenman2. This pack features quests, custom recipes, and a custom world with custom structures. This book will provide you with tips to help you get on your feet in the world, and also provide challenges for you to accomplish. To ensure you do not spawn off the tree, /gamerule spawnRadius 0 is used, if game rules are reset, make sure this is set back to normal so new players don't fall! This pack is balanced for HQM Normal Mode, as the pack will not give Hardcore Mode Hearts. It is also balanced to allow every player in quest parties to get the rewards, and not just one. Good luck!
